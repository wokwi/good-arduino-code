This project implements an electronic safe, powered by an Arduino Uno.

The safe has three main components:
An [16x02 LCD Monitor](https://wokwi.com/playground/lcd1602)
and a [Membrane Keypad](https://wokwi.com/playground/keypad) for the
user interface, and a Servo motor that powers the lock mechanism.

The state of the safe (locked/unlocked), as well as the secret code
are stored in the Arduino's [EEPROM](https://wokwi.com/playground/eeprom), so
the code isn't wiped even when the power goes off.

### Code Structure

The code is divided into three modules:

- [sketch.ino](#source-sketch_ino) - Main program code, including the user interface
- [icons.cpp](#source-icons_cpp) - Provides the locked/unlocked icon for the LCD screen
- [SafeState.cpp](#source-safestate_cpp) - Manages the state of the safe and the secret code, and stores them in the EEPROM memory.
